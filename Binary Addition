/* hyy so i have two approches to solve this one:-
1. Long one in which u first convert the a and b to decimal add them and convert back
2. An optimize in which u do binary add and store it in "ans" string and return it rather then converting the whole binary string into decimal.
*/
// so where is the second one explained with comments :D.
